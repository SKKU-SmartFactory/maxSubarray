# Linked List Insertion Sort Implementation

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will implement an insertion sort algorithm using a linked list data structure in C.

Your task is to modify the array-based insertion sort implementation to work more easily with linked lists. This is a warm-up exercise to welcome you to the Algorithm course.

Since the input size is not determined in advance, you cannot pre-allocate a fixed-size array. The linked list-based implementation allows you to dynamically allocate memory as needed.

---

## Task

**Convert to Linked List**: Transform the provided array-based insertion sort into a linked list implementation

   - Keep the current function names. You cannot change the current function names.
   - You may create any additional functions and structures needed
   - Design your own Node structure and linked list operations
   - The only constraint is that your program must perform insertion sort using a linked list

---

## Input Format

- A sequence of integers, each on a new line or separated by spaces
- Input is terminated by EOF or non-integer input

---

## Output Format

- The sorted sequence of integers, separated by spaces
- A newline character at the end

---

## Example

### Input:
```
5 2 9 1 5 6
```

### Output:
```
1 2 5 5 6 9
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. Submit a single C file named "run.c" containing your complete implementation
2. Include detailed comments explaining your approach
3. Ensure your code compiles without warnings and passes all test cases

Good luck!
